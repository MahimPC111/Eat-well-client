live site link: "https://eat-well-1b6e3.web.app/"

In this project I have used:
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Tailwind etc.

#### Project description:
At first I installed React App in my drive(C:). Then I gave a name to it. After then I installed Firebase, Vercel, Tailwind, DaisyUI, React hot toast, React font awesome, React router dom and many others. I divided the whole project into small parts as components and started to work on it so that it makes easier for me to work properly in this project. So, I started working on components one by one and also made them Mobile view responsive. I tried to keep all the code fresh. I have deployed my server site in vercel and my client site in firebase. I have committed more than 15+ git commits for my client site and more than 8+ git commits for my server site.
